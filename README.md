# SeedShuffler

[SeedShuffler](https://seedshuffler.com) is a free tool to generate your personal and 100% unique seed number matrix.
The tool, which is open sourced, generates an unique mix of numbers, based on the Original BIP39 2048 word list, but "shuffled" so it gets truly unique.

SeedShuffler is developed by [FortKnoxster DieFi](https://fortknoxster.com), the crypto recovery and inheritance platform.
